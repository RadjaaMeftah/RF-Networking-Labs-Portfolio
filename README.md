# 🚀 RF & Networking Labs Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of **Cisco Packet Tracer projects**, designed to showcase my **networking expertise** alongside my strong background in **radiofrequency engineering**.  

As highlighted in my CV, I hold **three CCNA certifications** (Networks, Switching/Routing/Wireless, Enterprise Networking & Automation). These labs serve as practical demonstrations of my ability to **design, configure, and troubleshoot IP networks**, complementing my RF experience in antenna design and characterization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- ✔️ Demonstrate mastery of **routing protocols** (OSPF, RIP, static routing)  
- ✔️ Configure **VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, and wireless networks**  
- ✔️ Simulate **end-to-end IP network scenarios** that could integrate RF systems  
- ✔️ Highlight troubleshooting and **support engineering skills** relevant to telecom projects
